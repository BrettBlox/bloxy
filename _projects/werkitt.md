description: 'I don't think I can say much about this application as it is yet to be launched, but is pretty awesome. A headless ecommerce site built with Next.js, Shopify, and a Laravel backend. I have been responsible for adding most of the front-end Next.js portion of the site as well as building a React application served from the Laravel app that was embedded into the Shopify dashboard that helps manage company internals. This site has been a deep dive into headless ecommerce development and will be our foundation for all projects moving forward.'
