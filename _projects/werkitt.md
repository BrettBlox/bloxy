  "I don't think I can say much about this application as it is yet to be
  launched, but is pretty awesome. A headless ecommerce site built with Next.js,
  Shopify, and a Laravel backend. I have been responsible for adding most of the
  front-end Next.js portion of the site as well as building a React application
  served from the Laravel app that was embedded into the Shopify dashboard that
  helps manage company internals. This site has been a deep dive into headless
  ecommerce development and will be our foundation for all projects moving
  forward."
